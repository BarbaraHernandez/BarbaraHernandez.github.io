## About Me
I am an organized person by nature. I have a methodical, compartmentalized approach to work. I am also an excellent communicator, and I work well in teams. There is no task too small for my attention. I am the person who will do whatever the project requires of me.

## About My Portfolio
I have intentionally not used a CSS framework for my portfolio. I wanted to show what I can do with just my own CSS. The technology used here is, essentially, only HTML and CSS. I prefer to let my projects speak to my skills with other technologies, which simply weren't necessary for this application.
