##About Me
I am an organized person by nature. I have a methodical, compartmentalized approach to work. I am also and excellent communicator, and I work well in teams. There is no task too small for my attention. I am the person who will do whatever the project requires of me.

##About My Portfolio
I have intentionally not used a CSS framework for my portfolio. I wanted to show what I can do with just my own CSS.
